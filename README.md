# DeepSARFlood

DeepSARFlood is a deep learning-based tool for rapid and automated flood inundation mapping using SAR data. By leveraging weak flood labels from concurrent optical imagery, our approach refines flood detection using cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures. Optimized through multitask learning and model soups, DeepSARFlood integrates a novel gain algorithm to enhance ensemble diversity and provide robust uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate that ViT-based and CNN-ViT hybrid models surpass traditional CNNs, achieving a state-of-the-art IoU score of 0.72 on the Sen1Floods11 dataset, setting a new benchmark for flood mapping accuracy and reliability.

This repo provides the codebase for the tool, along with the model weights.
